        <p>(6). Where personal information collecting and processing are for the sake of safeguarding significant legal rights and interests, such as the life and property of personal information subjects or other individuals, but it is difficult to obtain their consent;</p>
        <p>(7). Where responses to the requests of the personal information subject will give rise to serious damage to the legal rights and interests of the personal information subject or any other individual or organization; or</p>
        <p>(8). Where requests involve trade secrets.</p>
